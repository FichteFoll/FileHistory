File History
============

Provides access to the history of accessed files - project-wise or globally.
The most recently closed file can be instantly re-opened with a keyboard
shortcut. Furthermore, you can search through the entire file history with a
quick panel (including file preview and the ability to open multiple files).

For a changelog, see CHANGELOG.md.

Usage
-----

To use the plugin, open the Command Palette and search for `File History:`. You
can see the default key bindings in the palette, or alternatively browse
"Preferences > Package Settings > File History > Key Bindings - Default" in the
menu.
