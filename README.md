# SublimeText - File History #

**Sublime Text 2 and 3** plugin
to provide access to the history of recently used files -
project-wise or globally.

The most recently closed file
can be instantly re-opened
or the entire file history
can be shown and filtered in a quick panel
(including file preview
and the ability to open multiple files).

## Features ##

* Reopen the most recently closed file 
  or open a quick panel of recently used files 
  to choose from
* Display a preview of the file
  while browsing the quick panel
  (only Sublime Text 3)
* Open multiple history entries
  from the quick panel
  with the <kbd>Right</kbd> key
* Delete history entries from the quick panel
  with <kbd>Ctrl + Del</kbd>
* Optionally remove any non-existent files
  while looking through the file history
  (when previewed or opened)
  or on start-up
* Creates backups 
  in case you lose your history
* Highly configurable through [FileHistory.sublime-settings][] file,
  like excluding files with regex patterns


## Installation ##

1. Install [Package Control][pck-ctrl].
2. Once installed,
   bring up the Command Palette
   (`Command-Shift-P` on OS X, `Ctrl-Shift-P` on Linux/Windows).
3. Select `Package Control: Install Package`
   and then select `File History` when the list appears.

Package Control will automagically keep the plugin up to date.


## Usage ##

To use the plugin,
open the Command Palette
and search for `File History:`.

When you opened a panel
you can use the <kbd>Right</kbd> key
to open the file and keep the panel open,
or <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd + Del</kbd>
to remove the selected file from the history.

For default keymap definitions,
see [Default (Windows).sublime-keymap][keymap] ([OSX][keymap-osx]).

For the available and default settings,
see [FileHistory.sublime-settings][].

### Project Settings ###

You can **extend**
the `path_exclude_patterns` and `path_reinclude_patterns` lists
in your project settings.

For this,
add a `"file_history"` dictionary
to your project's settings
and then one or both of the settings to that.
Example:

```json
{
    "folders": [
        {
            "path": "."
        }
    ],
    "settings": {
        "file_history": {
            "path_exclude_patterns": ["/bin/"],
            "path_reinclude_patterns": ["\\.compiled$"]
        }
    }
}
```
